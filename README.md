# Space Cats

## Introduction

Space Cats is an application that is a part of the fourth mod of the Front End Engineering Program at the [Turing School of Software and Design](turing.io). [The task is simple:](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/final-countdown.html) build an application that displays the NASA Picture of the Day for the current day, allow users to scroll back and see the pictures from previous days, and have a single button that allows users to return to the current day.

## Challenges

As of January 9th, 2019, the NASA Picture-of-the-Day API is down, presumably because of the goverment shutdown. In order to make my application make API calls to -something- that serves up urls to space pictures, I built one using Node.js and Express. You can find the repo for the back end deployment [here](https://github.com/relasine/space-cats-deployed).

Additionally, this project requires the student to code the front end in Vue.js, a framework that few of us are acquainted with. While we have spent quite a bit of time with React, I, personally, have had no experience at all with Vue.

## The Application

Me being me, I couldn't just serve up pictures of space, so I grabbed a bunch of cat pictures, cropped them in Photoshop, built a helper file to help randomize them, and super-imposed them on the images of space. YOU'RE WELCOME.
